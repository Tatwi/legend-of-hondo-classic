[color=#ff8c00][i]I've had this doc sitting in my blog drafts here since Sept. of last years. I think it's about time I posted here for you guys to provide some feedback on the system. I think I mentioned it in the post, but it will take a long time / a lot of work to bring this system to life. However, I think it would rock.[/i][/color]

[b]Overview:[/b]

Since the beginning and all the way to the end, Star Wars Galaxies needed and failed to have missions where Smugglers actually smuggled stuff. It's a feature that has been requested a thousand times and because of that, Kinshi has decided to make it happen on the Tarkin server.

The premise of smuggling something, on the surface, is really quite simple - successfully take some stuff from point A to point B. However, when is life ever that straight forward and without drama? Something always happens to throw a wrench in the machinery, causing all hell to break loose, or at the very least a power coupling to become uncoupled and the hyperdrive to fail. Or maybe those unmarked crates your carrying in your cargo hold are just too good for a group of pirates to let slip by...

[b]Mission Basics:[/b]

Smuggler Missions take place in stages, with more rewarding and difficult missions having more stages to complete. The flow of missions is generally like so,
[LIST=1]
[*]Visit your preferred underworld hang out and hit up your contacts for a job. The more skilled of a Smuggler you are, the more people will be willing to give you a job. Oh and you can trust that the worst jobs will have pretty terrible pay until you make a name for yourself.[/*]
[*]Head to the co-ordinates where the goods are being loaded onto a transport and commandeer that transport, kid! I would suspect that the most precious cargo will have some for of security keeping an eye on it, ya just never know these days...[/*]
[*]One you board the ship you'll need to fly or drive it to the either a drop point where someone else will pick it up (easy) or you'll have to head to a rendezvous point and transport to the final destination on foot. Watch out for pirates and bounty hunters (including player bounty hunters)![/*]
[*]Should your mission require you to haul ass on foot through hostile territory, be on the look out for safe house where you can take a breather. But keep in mind that the clock is ticking and if you don't make it to the drop point in time there will be hell to pay![/*]
[*]Once at your final destination, you may need to slice or charm your way passed some local security. Nothing a Smuggler like you can't handle, right? It really all depend on who is trying to smuggle what into where, but I'm sure they'll tell you all the details when they give you the mission! (laughs out loud)[/*]
[*]Once you've successfully completed your mission, pull out your holo-communicator and confirm it with your boss. He'll tell the recipient to pay you, "or else". I'm sure that'll be fine.[/*]
[/LIST]
[b]Game Mechanics:[/b]
[LIST]
[*][b]Mission Givers[/b] are NPCs who have simple screenplay dialog that brings up a sui window listing 6 available missions. Access to these NPCs will be based upon the player's faction standing with various underworld and criminal type factions. For instance, if a player has high standing with Jabba the Hutt and also has high standing with Lady Valarian, neither are going to be particularly trust worthy of the player, because it's not clear where the player's allegiance is. Basically, being friends with someone's enemy isn't good for business. Number caps will remain in the -5000 to + 5000 range, where anything over 2500 has a chance to trigger that "you're too friendly with [i]them[/i]" aspect. Anything over 4000 with an enemy faction and you'll only be trusted to the shit jobs, even as a well known Master Smuggler AND have 5000 standing with the people you're trying to work for.[/*]
[*][b]Mission Types [/b]are essentially easy, medium, and hard. Easy missions are delivery missions on steroids, effectively delivery missions on the same planet that cause the player to be added to the Bounty Hunter Terminals. Medium and hard missions are comprised of components that are selected randomly upon creation, each component being either a stage or an event trigger. Easy missions have only one stage and up to two triggers.[/*]
[*][b]Stages[/b] are points of defined interaction in the mission. The following are all the possible stages: Pickup, Land, Repair, Infiltration, Pickup secondary mandatory objective, and Deliver.[/*]
[*][b]Pickup[/b]: Mission Givers will create a waypoint in the player's datapad where they will find the goods they need to either pick up without resistance or have to steal. Possible locations will be a combination of static screen play locals and randomly spawned theaters. At each location there will be a physical ship model, NPCs (either neutral or hostile), and some other decor that fills out the scene. The player must access a special ship terminal or speak to or kill an NPC to "fly away" and move on to the next stage. Pickups for easy missions won't teleport the player to another location, but more complex missions will involve moving the player around the galaxy this way to simulate flying the ship that was at the pick up point.[/*]
[*][b]Land:[/b] When the player is sent to another planet, they will "land" at a random location and theater will spawn that fills out the roleplay of the mission. These landing zones are often where an event will be triggered, while the player waits up to 30 seconds while the cargo is "transfered to his vehicle/mount/person".[/*]
[*][b]Repair:[/b] While at a pickup point, the player may need to use his slicing knowledge to repair something that was damaged on the ship before he can take off. This will use the slicing interaction method. I *might* also be able to cause the player's vehicle to break down at random, based on the amount of HAM it has. Slicing the vehicle while on a mission will bring the HAM up - one chance per event. Using a garage would also work.[/*]
[*][b]Infiltration:[/b] The player may need to unlock doors or speak to NPCs to gain access to locations. This will use the number pad and conversation interfaces. The player will have the options to charm, bribe, or kill (with the possibility to fail the mission) NPCs that act as "locked doors" to the next part of the mission. Killing the NPC may result in failure, because he might not have had a key to the door and there is no panel to slice, so the player can't advance - should have bribed or charmed him to radio to someone else to open the door![/*]
[*][b]Pickup Secondary:[/b] Difficult missions may trigger the boss to add more work at the last minute. This is a second instance of a pickup and can spawn as a theater anywhere on the same planet as the final destination. It may be a hostile or a friendly pickup.[/*]
[*][b]Deliver:[/b] This is conversation that takes place at the end of the mission when the player reaches the final destination. There will be options in there for bribing and charming to get a bit more of a payout, however it can back fire and the player can lose some standing with the faction that gave them the mission.[/*]
[*][b]Events[/b] are random things that can happen along the between the Stages. There are three types of events, Pirates, Bounty Hunters, and The Empire. Depending on the difficulty of the mission and the number of stages, the player may encounter multiple events throughout the mission. However there will only be one such event per stage. Note that these events can even happen in the first stage before the player even picks up the goods![/*]
[*][b]Pirates:[/b] It may surprise you, but these are the most reasonable NPCs of the bunch. They can easily be bribed to take a percent of the cut when you deliver the goods, reducing the mission payout. However, you can also double cross them in the and take a big hit in standing with their faction. Pirates will either parle or attack on sight. If they attack on sight they may parle when the boss is the last man standing. The boss is unattackable when in parle, but can become attackable again if he does not come to an agreement with the player. Running away from pirates will cause the mission to be fail, as the player is ditching his cargo.[/*]
[*][b]Bounty Hunters[/b] on the hand don't want to talk. The only saving grace is that they usually work alone and many of them really quite terrible at their jobs. Running away from pirates will cause the mission to be fail, as the player is ditching his cargo.[/*]
[*][b]The Empire[/b] are an interesting lot, not easily bribed, but often amusingly dim witted. They will always stop the player to parle and it is always wise for the player to try and talk their way around these guys, especially if they're well equipped. Failing to fool or bribe them, the player will have to get out of dodge as quickly as possible. The player can run from the Empire without failing the mission, once the empire becomes aggressive, however this may be easier said than done.[/*]
[*][b]Player Bounty Hunters:[/b] Perhaps the most important aspect of Smuggler Missions is that once accepted, the player gets added to the Bounty Hunter terminals until the mission is completed. Should the player fail the mission, they remain on the terminals with an even higher price on their heads, on top of the loss of standing with the faction that gave them their mission. Failed missions will leave the player on the terminal for longer periods the more times the player fails missions while they are on the terminal. So fail once and they might be up there for 5 hours after the failure, but fail twice and they may be up there for 3 days. Should a player Bounty Hunter find a the Smuggler, they will always fight to the death or until Smuggler makes it to a safe house.[/*]
[*][b]Safe Houses[/b] are player structures that have been place (and decorated by volunteers) in the world for the purpose giving Smugglers somewhere to run to safety from a player Bounty Hunter [i]while their mission[/i] is in progress. Given that smuggling missions must be completed before the timer runs out, the player can't hide forever without failing their mission. When a Smuggler begins a mission he will be added to the entry list of all safe houses. Only Smugglers on missions have access to these locations. Note that a crafty Bounty Hunter could enter a safe house to follow a mark if he too takes a Smuggler Mission, but doing so would add him to the Bounty Hunter terminals as well. It's possible that we could put some interesting perks for Smuggler in these houses.[/*]
[*][b]Mission Timer:[/b] Each level of mission will grant the player a certain amount of time to complete the mission. Easy missions must be completed within 15 minutes, Medium missions within 30 minutes, and Difficult missions within 60 minutes.[/*]
[*][b]Transportation:[/b] Players may use their own vehicles to travel between stages, however the use of the public transit system is far too risky will cause immediate failure of the mission. With this in mind, travel between planets will take place at the pickup location when missions require this. For missions that take place on the same planet as the mission giver, the player is free to drive or walk there.[/*]

[b]Development Details[/b]

I suspect that a system of this magnitude will take several months to complete. As such, I would like to break it down into logical blocks of self contained work that can be completed and added to the game. The blocks I have in mind are,
[LIST]
[*]Easy Mission Themepark[/*]
[*]Medium Mission Themepark [/*]
[*]Hard Mission Themepark [/*]
[*]Mission Giver placement[/*]
[*]Safe House placement and decoration[/*]
[*]Static Delivery location placement and decoration[/*]
[*]Static Pickup location creations[/*]
[*]Landing/Pickup "theater" creation[/*]
[*]Player Bounty system tie in[/*]
[*]NPC faction standing system [/*]
[*]Event programming [/*]
[/LIST]
The most logical, immersive, and fun way I believe Smuggler missions could be added to the game is as repeatable, randomized themeparks. Simply going up to a terminal and picking what amounts to a PvP enabled delivery mission simply isn't good enough to be enjoyable and it doesn't make use of the tools we have available. Using the themepark logic, the conversation system, some other LUA programming and a bit of C++, we can piece together a wicked awesome system sever side without having to waste time dicking around with the client and the UI, which is seriously no fun at all. Nothing on the list of content for this system would require a client side update, yet look how full of content that list is! Pretty awesome, eh?
